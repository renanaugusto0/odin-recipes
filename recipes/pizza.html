    <p> A well-crafted pizza is a symphony of flavors. Picture the first bite: the crust, golden and slightly crispy, yielding to your teeth. The tomato sauce, rich and tangy, dances across your palate, harmonizing with the creamy, melted mozzarella cheese.</p>
    <p>The magic happens in the oven. The high heat caramelizes the sugars in the sauce, intensifying their flavors. The crust transforms—crispy at the edges, yet soft in the center. It’s like biting into a warm hug. And don’t forget the umami—the elusive fifth taste—courtesy of the cheese.</p>

        <li><strong>Spritz the Pan:</strong> Use cooking spray on a pizza pan or improvise with a flipped-over baking sheet.</li>
        <li><strong>Spread the Dough:</strong> Press the dough onto the pan to form your crust.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Sauce and Toppings:</strong> Mix tomato purée with minced garlic and red wine vinegar. Top the dough with sauce, cheese, and your favorite toppings. </li>
