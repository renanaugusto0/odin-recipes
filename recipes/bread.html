    <h2>Principal Way To Do Bread</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mixing:</strong>Combine flour, water, yeast, and salt to form a dough.Knead the dough until it’s smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li><strong>Rising (First Proof):</strong> Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it, and let it rise until doubled in size (usually 1-2 hours).Yeast ferments the dough, creating air bubbles.</li>
        <li><strong>Shaping:</strong>Punch down the risen dough to release excess gas. Shape it into the desired form (loaf, baguette, etc.)</li>
        <li><strong>Second Proof:</strong>Let the shaped dough rise again (about 30-60 minutes).</li>
        <li><strong>Baking:</strong>Preheat the oven.Score the top of the dough to allow expansion.Bake until golden brown and hollow-sounding when tapped.</li>
        <li><strong>Cooling:</strong>Let the bread cool on a wire rack.Enjoy fresh or store in an airtight container.</li>
    </ol>
