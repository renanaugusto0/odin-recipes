            <p>Lasagna, also known as lasagne, is a beloved Italian dish that has stood the test of time. It’s made from very wide, flat sheets of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types.</p>

        <h2>Principal Way To Do Lasagna</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Pasta:</strong> Boil wide, flat lasagna sheets until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the Ragù:</strong> In a skillet, brown ground beef or pork with onions and garlic. Add crushed tomatoes, herbs (like basil and oregano), salt, and pepper. Simmer until thickened.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Béchamel Sauce:</strong> In a separate saucepan, melt butter, add flour, and cook until golden. Gradually whisk in milk until smooth. Season with salt and nutmeg.</li>
            <li><strong>Layer the Lasagna:</strong> In a baking dish, start with a layer of ragù, followed by pasta sheets, béchamel, and a mix of ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan. Repeat until all ingredients are used up.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake and Serve:</strong> Cover with foil and bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for about 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes until bubbly and golden. Let it rest before serving.</li>
